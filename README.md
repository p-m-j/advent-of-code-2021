Run in linqpad 7

~Not trying to be elegant or efficient, just having fun so don't judge too harshly.~

Not aiming for perfection, just having fun so don't judge too harshly.

That said I really wasn't happy with my naive first attempt for day 5 which ran for ~8 seconds so I guess I do care
a little about optimizing for runtime.


## Results

| Day | Both parts included | Runtime       | Comments                                                     |
|-----|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.001 seconds |                                                              |
| 2   | :x:                 | 0.001 seconds | Overwrote part 1, before I was planning on sharing           |
| 3   | :x:                 | 0.007 seconds | Overwrote part 1, before I was planning on sharing           |
| 4   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.033 seconds |                                                              |
| 5   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.046 seconds | First attempt took ~8 seconds to run for part 1              |
| 6   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.001 seconds | First attempt out of memory part 2, also very long runtime   |
| 7   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.18 seconds  | Pretty good first try, could probably cleanup but I'm happy. |
| 8   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.006 seconds | That was a right PITA                                        |
| 9   | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.010 seconds | Rushed catching up, probably much better ways to solve.      |
| 10  | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.001 seconds | Sounded more fun than it was.                                |
| 11  | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.035 seconds | Rushed catching up, probably much better ways to solve.      |
| 12  | :heavy_check_mark:  | ~6.5 seconds  | Didn't enjoy this one.                                       |
| 13  | :heavy_check_mark:  | 0.001 seconds | Day 13 was really good fun!!!                                |
